StitchVerse

StitchVerse is a decentralized platform where seamstresses and fashion creators from around the world can showcase their designs, receive fair payments, and collaborate on custom pieces — all powered by the Solana blockchain.

Each garment is registered as a Fashion NFT, containing details like fabric, maker, hours worked, and pricing. Buyers can purchase or co-create pieces, while creators earn royalties on secondary sales. Seamstresses are rated not by social likes but by on-chain skill proofs, such as verified patterns or production metrics.

It also introduces Proof of Craft — a system where creators mint a badge showing they physically produced a piece, verified via timestamped photos or IoT integration.
Over time, top creators gain visibility and governance rights over the platform's direction.
